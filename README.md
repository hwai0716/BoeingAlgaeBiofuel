Algae is a biofuel source and an eco-friendly wastewater treatment method. 
This repository pertains to the development of an Electroporator [1], a Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) generator. 

PEF pulses (3.33MV/m to 10MV/m intensity), pulse length (5μs to 95μs), pulse period (10μs to 100μs), and number of 
pulses (10+) are applied to algae cells for lipid extraction. The algae sample is suspended between two conductor-coated 
(Indium Tin Oxide, ITO) microscope slides separated by 0.03 mm. Required field intensity range (3.33MV/m to 10MV/m) 
corresponds to minimum voltage range 100V to 300V.
